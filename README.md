# Hydration Reminder App

## Introduction

The Hydration Reminder App is a simple Python application designed to remind users to drink water at regular intervals. It utilizes the `pyttsx3` library to provide auditory reminders and the `tkinter` library for message box alerts.

## How It Works

1. Run the Python script `hydration_reminder.py`.
2. Enter your name when prompted. This name will be used in the reminders.
3. Input the number of seconds after which you want the application to remind you to drink water again.

The application will then run in a loop, sending reminders to drink water to you based on the time interval you specified.

## Features

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `hydration_reminder.py` file is located.
4. Run the script using the command: `python hydration_reminder.py`.
5. Follow the on-screen prompts to set your name and reminder interval.
